# Battle Locomotives

This modification adds 3 new locomotives to the game. They have the same resitances as the modular armor and both power armors. Together with a equipment grid, they are pretty powerful for combat.
Adds 2 more [Braking force](https://wiki.factorio.com/Braking_force_(research)) technologies to the game.
